#packages....
#smallest unit of modules is function
#when we bind function files in py then it known as module
#when we bind modules thenit conside as packages
#packages--it ia an encapsulation machanism to group module inn signle unit.
#This consider as package.Any directory or folder contain __int__.py known as pythonpackage.it is empty file but it is necessary so python can consider it as package file
#package also contain sub package
#here we resolve naming conflict..we can use add function in every module with different works
#it improves modularity of application
#if we have same function in different module then it doesn't give any error, it override
