multi tasking----
performing more than one task at a time is called multi-tasking.
-process based |OS level multitasking
	using multiple appplication at same on same application


-thread based | APPILCATION LEVEL MULTI-TASKING
	EXECUTING MORE THAN ONE METHOD OR  FUNCTION AT SAME TIME IN A SAME PROGRAM.(RESPONSE TIME WILL BE REDUCED OF APPLICATION)

THREAD------ IT IS A FLOW OF EXECUTION.


PYTHON NEVER DO WORK IN ITS OWN IT ALWAYS  GO TO PVM AND PVM MAKES MAIN THREAD(ONE OF THE EMPLOYESS OF PVM).THEN MAIN THREAD DO SOME PROCESSING AND THEN THREAD GOES TO
PROGRAM AND CHECK SYNTAX.PERFORMMING EACH LINE ONE BY ONE.



MULTITHREADING---------AFTER PROCESSING WE WRITE A SPEICAL LINE OF CODE BEFORE THE STARTING OF CODING.

IN GUI CONCEPT OF MULTITHREADING IS COMPULSORY.

WE REMOVE HANG USING MULTITHREAD IN OUR GUI.

IN  PYTHON EVERYTHING IS A OBJECT.

PYTHON HAS MODULE NAME THREADING WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE STUFF REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH MULTI-THREADING


there are two ways of creating thread
