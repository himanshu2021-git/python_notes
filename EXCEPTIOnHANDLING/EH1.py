#Exception handling...----------

#EXCEPTION--- it is an unwanted event which disturbs normal flow of execution
#Exceptions are always handlable.

#-Compile time error | CHECKED exception -these excpetion are already known by the interpretor or the compiler of language so whenever you write the code which may raise
#exception the interpetor or compiler will stop you at the time of compilation.


#Syntax error-this is a compile time error,this is the only checked exception python has

#Run time error | Unchecked exception--- these exception are encountered at the time of the running the code and these exception are not known by the compiler or interpretor.

#Partially Checked exception-- these exceptions are the some time checked and sometime not.


#ERRORS- errors are also unwanted event which terminates the flow of execution,errors are never ever handlable.

#Mainthread asks with code these question after finding exception.
#1-create object of exception. 2-do you have handling code. 3-who was your caller. 4- abnormal termination
#without executing each and every single line of function the call will be removed from stack and execution will be terminated.
