#MODULE PROGRAMMING..........
#--------------------------------
#each and every python saved file is called python module, but they aren't proper module.beacause module programming has a structure.



#PCKAGES>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
#-------------------------------------
#package is a folder in which various python modules are placed.
#python always convert module into low level language. found in __pycache__

#1. BUILT-IN PACKAGES MODULE | PREDEFINE | LIBRARY MODULE OR PACKAGES.

#every module has a documentation string inside it """  """ inside this and they stored in __doc__
"""
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main() #function name........execute only when you try to execute these module direclty if we import the file then the code is not seen"""
